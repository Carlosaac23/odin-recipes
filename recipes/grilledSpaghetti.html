    <h1>Grilled Spaghetti</h1>
    <img src="../images/grilledspaghetti.webp" alt="Grilled Spaghetti Photo" />

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Grilled spaghetti is cooked directly in a very simple sauce, so that all the extra flavor from toasting dry pasta on a grill stays in the sauce. This is
      delicious on its own as a side dish, or as a base for other grilled things like eggplant or chicken.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces thick dry spaghetti</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>3 clove garlic, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 rounded tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>3 3/4 cups chicken broth, plus more as needed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste, depending on salt level of broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/4 cup basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
      <li>1/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch red chili flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step
        <p>Prepare an outdoor charcoal grill for medium-high heat.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step
        <p>
          Place dry spaghetti on the hot charcoal grill, and cook, tossing often with tongs until the pasta is toasted to a light brown, about 4 minutes. Remove
          and set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step
        <p>
          Add olive oil to a pan, and set over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add tomato paste and sauté for about 1
          minute; pour in broth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step
        <p>
          Raise heat to medium-high and bring broth to a simmer. Add salt and grilled spaghetti, and use tongs to move spaghetti back and forth until it softens
          enough to be covered by the broth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step
        <p>
          Cook, stirring, until spaghetti is as tender as you like; it will take a few minutes longer than package directions indicate. If pan gets too dry, add
          another splash of broth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step
        <p>Reduce heat to low; stir in butter and basil. Turn off heat and stir in cheese. Serve immediately.</p>
