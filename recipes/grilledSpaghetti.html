      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Grilled spaghetti is cooked directly in a very simple sauce, so that all the extra flavor from toasting dry pasta on a grill stays in the sauce. This is
        delicious on its own as a side dish, or as a base for other grilled things like eggplant or chicken.
      </p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>8 ounces thick dry spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 clove garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 rounded tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 3/4 cups chicken broth, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste, depending on salt level of broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
        <li>1/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch red chili flakes (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>Prepare an outdoor charcoal grill for medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>
          Place dry spaghetti on the hot charcoal grill, and cook, tossing often with tongs until the pasta is toasted to a light brown, about 4 minutes. Remove
          and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add olive oil to a pan, and set over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add tomato paste and sauté for about 1
          minute; pour in broth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Raise heat to medium-high and bring broth to a simmer. Add salt and grilled spaghetti, and use tongs to move spaghetti back and forth until it softens
          enough to be covered by the broth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook, stirring, until spaghetti is as tender as you like; it will take a few minutes longer than package directions indicate. If pan gets too dry, add
          another splash of broth.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low; stir in butter and basil. Turn off heat and stir in cheese. Serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
